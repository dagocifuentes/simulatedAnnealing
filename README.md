# Simulated Annealing
Simulated annealing metaheuristic for the traveling salesman problem in Arduino

Hello! In this project, I'm trying to implement a Simulated Annealing metaheuristic to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem using an Arduino UNO.
The project is on its begining, so the code is a little messy, but from time to time I'm going to be updating it. (And making an english version of it).
